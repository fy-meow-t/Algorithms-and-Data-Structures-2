Assignment 2 in semester 2, 2018 (second year) with full marks. A general textual search application to search on a single document or collection of documents.

A test file under tst.comp3506.assn2.testdriver to test the functionalities.

The application is in tst.comp3506.assn2.application.AutoTester whose methods perform the following searches:
1. Count the number of occurrences of a word.
2. Search for a single word.
3. Search for a prefix of a word. (e.g. Searching for “obscure” would find “obscure”, “obscured”,
“obscures” and “obscurely”.
4. Search for a phrase, where a phrase is a sequence of words that are contiguous (e.g. “to be or
not to be”).
5. Implement boolean search logic for the operators AND, OR and NOT.
